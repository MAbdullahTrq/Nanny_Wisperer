## Deployment

**After making any file changes to this project, always deploy to Vercel production.**

1. Run: `vercel --prod` (from the project root).
2. On Windows PowerShell use: `cd "<project-root>"; vercel --prod` (semicolon, not `&&`).
3. Confirm the deployment completes successfully before considering the task done.

Do not skip deployment unless the user explicitly asks not to deploy.
