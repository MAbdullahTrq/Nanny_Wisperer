**🧠 Suggestions for System Logic**

- **Mutual Compatibility Scoring**:
  - Build a logic layer that compares tags (e.g. nanny_gentle vs parent_structured) and returns a match score out of 100
  - Soft flags (e.g. smoker / no smoking home) can reduce the score
  - Must-match filters (language, experience) trigger exclusion
- **Tag Mapping**:  
    Use GHL or Laravel tags to automate matching queues:
  - pref_live_in vs req_live_in
  - lang_english_fluent vs lang_child_english
- **Smart Match UI**:
  - Admin view showing which inputs align
  - Highlight fields where a mismatch occurs (e.g., "Nanny prefers part-time, Family requests full-time")

## ****Match Scoring Algorithm (Total: 100 Points)****

### 🔹 ****Core Filters (Must-Have Match) - 40 points****

| **Match Criteria** | **Weight** | **Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location match | 10 pts | City or region is in both preferred lists |
| Start date compatibility | 5 pts | Nanny start date ≤ Parent desired start date |
| Live-in/out preference | 5 pts | Nanny preference matches host requirement |
| Availability match (days/hours) | 10 pts | Overlap in selected days/times |
| Age group experience | 10 pts | Nanny has experience in all required child age groups |

🔁 **If any of these fail**, match score = 0% or flag as **manual review needed**

### 🔹 ****Skills & Responsibilities - 20 points****

| **Match Criteria** | **Weight** | **Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task match (e.g. cooking, tutoring) | 10 pts | Score based on % of overlap in required skills |
| Travel expectation match | 5 pts | Nanny willing to travel = host needs travel |
| Driving & license match | 5 pts | Required by host and confirmed by nanny |

### 🔹 ****Values & Lifestyle Alignment - 20 points****

| **Match Criteria** | **Weight** | **Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parenting style alignment | 5 pts | Gentle/Balanced/Structured tags match or are close |
| Pet/smoking compatibility | 5 pts | No pet conflicts / smoking policy respected |
| Dietary match | 5 pts | Nanny can accommodate home diet & allergies |
| Religion/culture | 5 pts | Optional match; same or neutral = full points |

### 🔹 ****Bonus Criteria - 20 points****

| **Match Criteria** | **Weight** | **Rule** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language fluency match | 10 pts | Nanny speaks required languages (esp. with children) |
| Salary alignment | 5 pts | Nanny expected salary within host's budget |
| Extra certs or training | 5 pts | First Aid, Montessori, etc. verified and relevant |

## 🧮 ****Final Calculation Example****

Let's say:

- Core filters all match (40/40)
- 80% of skills required met (16/20)
- Full lifestyle match (20/20)
- Partial bonus (12/20)

👉 **Total Match Score** = **88%**

Use thresholds:

- ✅ 80-100%: Strong Match
- 🟡 60-79%: Review Recommended
- ❌ Below 60%: Flag or exclude
